**Assigment:**
1.  Learn about deepfakes (voice and video). Explore the current state of deepfakes detection methods (voice and video).
2.  Learn about the technologies needed to create web extensions and technologies for creating scalable server applications.
3.  Learn about existing deepfake detection solutions (e.g. other commercial web browser plug-ins)
4.  Design an extensible framework (server-client or client-only) for deepfakes detection (support for at least 3 detection methods (voice and video)). Design a web extension for deepfakes detection that will use this framework. The solution should support multiple browsers and allow the detection of displayed content and uploaded files.
5. Implement the tool according to the design.
6. Test the functionality and reliability of the resulting implementation. Perform testing on at least two independent publicly available deepfakes datasets.
7. Discuss usability, detection efficiency and possible extensions.
