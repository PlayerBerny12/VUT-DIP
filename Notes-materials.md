    ### Ruben Tolosana: An Introduction to Digital Face Manipulation
    - traditional -> time consuming, high skill level (special tools needed -> Photoshop)
    - automatic face syntetisis -> easy and fast, deep learning (big databases)
    - "deepfakes" -> 2017, reddit user anmed deepfake developed swaped algorithm
    - creating new faces - GAN
    - face manipulation - GAN
        - face morphing -> merging two faces to one
        - identity swap
    - expression swap
        - image animation
        - audio to video 

    ### Mathias Ibsen: Digital Face Manipulation in Biometric Systems
    - face swap, morphing and retouching techniques used to break biometrics systems
    - showing results of experiment on two biometrics systems with outputs (FMR, FNMR, ...)
    - adding new module to biometrics systems called `manipulation detection`
        - one image (looking for fragemtns, etc) - non deifrential detection, two images - diferencial detection

    ### Luisa Verdoliva: Multimedia Forensics Before the Deep Learning Era
    - creating fakes (aka cheapfakes) using programs such as Photoshop, GYMP
    - image manipulation techniques 
        - splicing (inserting object)
        - inpaiting (removing object)
        - copy-move (replication of object inside of image)
    - detection of fakes
        - digital integrity (blurred edges, replicated pixels, mangled compression, ...)
        - physical integrity (inconsistent shadows/lightning, ...)
        - semantic integrity (contradicting evidence in associated images or resources)
    - in-camera/out-camera processing 
    - detection analysis:
        - PRNU (Photo Respons Non-Uniformity noise) 
            - tiny imperfection in sensor (in every image)
            - fingerprint of device        
        - noise patterns
            - looking for deviation from expected model (anomaly detection)
        - compression
            - double compression, JPEG grid missaligment
        - editing artifacts
            - copy-move forgery detection (keypoint, dense field)
            - images, video, 3D
    - use multiple detection techniques to optain best results

    ### Pavel Korshunov: The Threat of Deepfakes to Computer and Human Visions
    - deepfake databases 
    - comparison of humans and algorithms on spotting deepfakes (human and computer visions are different)
    - proves that humans are not very good at spoting deepfakes (based on quality of fakes)
    - lack of generalization
    - binary classifiers 
        - depends on quality and size of dataset (can struggle on images that are easy for humans)
        - methods for improving results (extream data augmentation, few-shot tuning, ...)
    - comparison of binary and atribution classifiers (atribution clssifiers performs better)
        - same dataset and cross dataset scenarios
        - binary are not reliable on cross dataset scenarios but attribution classifiers can provide usefull informations
    
    ### Annalisa Franco: Morphing Attack Potential
    - morphing is seamless transition between two objects in computer graphics and animation
    - morhing attacks are used for forgery of documents
        - morphed images contains featrues of two people
    - landmarks (nose, eyes, contour, ...)
        - faces are aligned and image warping and blendig is used for actuall morphing
    - deep learning (potential use of GAN)
    - morphing is creating artefacts in images mostly in background
        - background substitotion
    - parameter alpha (how much is original person morphed to second person)
        - best results (0.3-0.4)
    - specific metrics for morphing attacks againts face regonition system
        - MMPMR, FMMPMR
        - MAP (Morphing attack potential)

    ### Kiran Raja: Adversarial Attacks on Face Recognition Systems
    - adding noise (noise, difrent view angle, ...) to the image (almost invisible for person) to attack recognition system
        - trying to push input image from one class to another
    - FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method)
    - PGD (Projected Gradient Descent)
    - putting adjusted images into learning dataset for FRS
    - detection:
        - quality of images (rejecting above threshold)
        - bias factor, investigation of boundry shifting, ...

    ### Vitomir Å truc: Photorealistic Face Editing via Latent Code Optimization
    - Video is not accessible

    ### Yuxin Wang: Talking Faces: Audio-to-Video Face Generation
    - creating 2D/3D facial model for specific person, creating audio representation from input a putting everything togeather
    - two pipelines
        - audio encoder and video encoder with with one decoder decoding audio into animated mouth movement
        - regression model using audio input to create generation or rendering output
    - post-processing
        - image refinement (teeth enhancment, ...)
        - background compositing
    - metrics - image quality, audio-lip sync, identity-preservation, blinking
    - chalanges - eyes/teeth control, head movement, emotions, generalization (identity, corpus), forgery detection
