    abstract = {The recent emergence of deepfakes has brought manipulated and generated content to the forefront of machine learning research. Automatic detection of deepfakes has seen many new machine learning techniques. Human detection capabilities,however,are far less explored. In this paper,we present results from comparing the abilities of humans and machines for detecting audio deepfakes used to imitate someone's voice. For this,we use a web-based application framework formulated as a game. Participants were asked to distinguish between real and fake audio samples. In our experiment,410 unique users competed against a state-of-the-art AI deepfake detection algorithm for 13229 total of rounds of the game. We find that humans and deepfake detection algorithms share similar strengths and weaknesses,both struggling to detect certain types of attacks. This is in contrast to the superhuman performance of AI in many application areas such as object detection or face recognition. Concerning human success factors,we find that IT professionals have no advantage over non-professionals but native speakers have an advantage over non-native speakers. Additionally,we find that older participants tend to be more susceptible than younger ones. These insights may be helpful when designing future cybersecurity training for humans as well as developing better detection algorithms.},

    abstract = {The social and democratic implications of deepfakes (also deep fakes) technology are widely debated in the United States and elsewhere. Yet,we know surprisingly little about how online users engage with this newer form of disinformation. This study is one of the first to explore the inadvertent deepfakes sharing behavior of the citizenry. Drawing on survey data collected in the United States and Singapore,this study investigates the role of political interest,cognitive ability,and social network size in inadvertent deepfakes sharing. The findings suggest that those with higher political interests are more likely to share deepfakes inadvertently. Those with lower cognitive ability are also more likely to share deepfakes inadvertently. The moderation findings suggest that the relationship between political interest and deepfakes sharing is significantly moderated by network size. As such,the likelihood of politically interested citizens sharing deepfakes intensifies in more extensive social networks. These results are consistent across both contexts.}
